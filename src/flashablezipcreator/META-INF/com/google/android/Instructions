Steps to Create a Flashable Zip

1. Add a Project, give it a name.(A project can have multiple groups)
A popup appears on start up, you can change the settings in File->Preferences.
2. Add a Group. (A group will contain specific type of files in it)
For eg. you create a group (say xyz) with install location (system/app), then xyz group will include all the apk files that needs to be pushed to system/app
3. Add a Subgroup if required (When you need furthur grouping. It is required for bootanimations and fonts)
For eg. 2 Boot Animations will have their own bootanimation.zip. You cannot add file with same name twice. Hence you need subgroup to further distinguish the file.
4. Add a Folder. (From android 5.x+, we have apk files placed in folder which contains optional lib files as well with it. To build the same directory structure, you need to add folders)
5. Add Files to Groups/Subgroups/Folders.
6. Click on Export Zip to choose the destination and Click OK to generate zip.

Finding it tedious to create again and again?

Don't worry, once you create a zip, you can import the created zip to make further changes to existing zip file.
To do so, use Import Zip button to add an already created zip OR drag the zip and add it to the tool.

Explore yourself to identify more hidden features.

Note: If universal-update-binary doesn't work for your device, fetch the update-binary from any working Rom of your device and place that update-binary in the same directory as of jar file. The tool will pick up that update-binary and create zip using that binary.
